# Siamese Neural Network
One-shot learning is a challenging task in machine learning, in which we need to classify a test image given one or limited training data.In this paper, we implemented one-shot image recognition via Siamese Neural Network (SNN) with few data on the quick-draw program. The SNN architecture shows its capability to learn features in limited training set, as well as identify new classes never trained before.

Description
===========
Include all the code written for SNN, SNN_final is the last version

SNN.pdf is the paper written for this project

Runs
===========
The SNN_final.py can be directly run to show 5 pairs of images as the pridection results.

Results
===========
The result file contains some of the results we test to show how the results look like.
